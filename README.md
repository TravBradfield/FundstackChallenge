# StyleList

This is Travis Bradfield's attempt at the Fundstack Angular Challenge. 

## NPM Install

Clone the repo on your local machine, navigate into the root directory and run 'npm install'. Once the npm modules
have been installed serve the app by running 'ng serve --open'.

## Notes

Data is persisted within the browser session, so as long as you don't close the browser tab when you navigate back to the styleList app the list of selected companies will persist. Should you close the tab or navigate to a new iteration of it the myCompanies list will be empty.

## Acknowledgement

I did use part of a free Bootstrap theme found at: https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/
